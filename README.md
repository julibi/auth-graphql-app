## auth-graphql-app

This is a react-graphql-app for learning more about authnetication used with graphql. For this purpose I cloned [auth graphql starter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/auth-graphql-starter)
by Stephen Grider, since I am following his Udemy Course on GraphQL with React. He is a great tutor btw! :)
